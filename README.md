# Medical Graph and Ground Truth 
## Introduction

We are facing the challenge of rapidly increasing amounts of data. Moreover, we observe that in many applications the underlying data contains strongly related entities making graphs the most appropriate structure for data modeling. When data is represented by means of a graph, querying corresponds to a graph matching problem. The present repository offers a novel graph that models information from the medical domain with about 110,000 nodes and 230,000 edges. Additionally we offer the ground truth of several basic benchmark queries, i.e. specific subgraphs, from different categories that can be found multiple times in the medical graph. Both the graph and the benchmark can be used free of charge to implement, test, and compare novel graph matching algorithms
